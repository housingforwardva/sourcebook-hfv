# sourcebook

This repository contains the foundation for HousingForward Virginia's (HFV) SOURCEBOOK, a free online resource for data on housing, demographic, and socioeconomic trends across the Commonwealth.

The previous iteration of SOURCEBOOK was built using a combination of R and Tableau. In order to provide greater replicability, sustainability, and transparency, HFV is fully transitioning SOURCEBOOK to R.

It is our hope that our documentation of data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization will provide housing practitioners with a better blueprint to take advantage of data.
