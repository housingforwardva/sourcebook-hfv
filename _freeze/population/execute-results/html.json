These trends help reveal how much, and for what reasons, population levels may be increasing or decreasing over time.\n\n## Total Population\n\nThis dashboard shows annual population counts and percent changes from 2010 to 2022. Data for 2010 and 2020 are from those years' Decennial Census counts; all other years use estimates from the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP).\n\n\n```{=html}\n\n<iframe id=\"example1\" src=\"https://housingforwardva.shinyapps.io/total_pop/\" style=\"border: none; width: 800px; height: 500px\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n```\n\n## Components of Population Change\n\nThis dashboard breaks down annual population changes by three different components:\n\n-   Natural increases (births minus deaths),\n-   Domestic migration (net moves from in/out of state), and\n-   International migration (net moves from in/out of the country).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Additional resources\n\n**U.S. Census Bureau**\n\n[*Virginia adds more than 600,000 people since 2010*](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/virginia-population-change-between-census-decade.html)\n\n**UVA Weldon Cooper Center**\n\n[*State population growth slows, with most new residents in Northern Virginia*](https://news.virginia.edu/content/state-population-growth-slows-most-new-residents-northern-virginia)\n\n[*Comparing 2020 Virginia population projections to the Census count*](https://statchatva.org/2021/09/27/comparing-2020-virginia-population-projections-to-the-census-count/)\n\n## Data sources\n\n[Census Population Estimates Program](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html) (PEP)\n\nAnnual estimates of total population released by the U.S. Census Bureau. Available at locality level from 2010 to 2019. Estimates by age, race, and ethnicity also available, along with components of population change.\n\n[2020 Decennial Census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html)\n\nInitial data from the 2020 Decennial Census is available in the PL 94-171 Redistricting summary file. As of February 2022, we use this data to append 2020 population counts onto the PEP time series data through 2019. Complete 2010 to 2020 Intercensal Estimates will be published in late 2022.\n",
